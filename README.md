# aiohttp_bootstrap
Just bootstrap for an aiohttp server. Pull it for a quick setup. Preconfigured to work
with default local redis and postgresql.

Look under server and run main.py to activate the server. 

Made by brian yeh, in case some interviewer wants you to bootstrap an api. Bootstrap
this. 

TODO: implement a sanic version of this for ludicrous speed.
